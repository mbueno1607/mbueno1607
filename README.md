## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MarÃ­lia, I am a brazilian Agronomic Engineering, currently doing my PhD in Germany. My main topic is quantitative bioeconomy where I study potato by-products as source of interesting compounds to be used as base for plant protection products. My research is a mixture of analytical chemistry, microbiology, and molecular biology/bioinformatics techniques.

Happy to join the GitHub team!

Cheers,
MarÃ­lia.
